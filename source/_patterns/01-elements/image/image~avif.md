## The `type` attribute on the `<source>` element within the `<picture>` HTML tag

> The `type` attribute specifies a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) for the resource URL(s) in the `<source>` element's `srcset` attribute. If the user agent does not support the given type, the `<source>` element is skipped.
