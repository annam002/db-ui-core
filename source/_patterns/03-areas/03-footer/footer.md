## Fixed positioned footer

You could set the footer area to fixed positioning by adding the class `has-fixed-footer` to the `body` HTML tag.

## Top border to seperate footer from main areas

You could set the footer area to get seperated via a top border by adding the class `has-border` to the `footer.rea-footer` HTML tag.

## Visual footer seperation

In case that a light background color for the main area is being used, the footer should get visually seperated by the grey border that is included as a default - but if the main area includes either a colorful or grey background, than disable/overwrite that `border-top` on the footer element (SCSS variable `$footer-â€‹--borderTop`).
