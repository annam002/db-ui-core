## Navigation variant

The [navigation variant](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#navigation) of this pattern includes navigational links for navigating the document or related documents instead of [menu interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu) via `button` elements, that are included within the regular `overflow menu` pattern.
