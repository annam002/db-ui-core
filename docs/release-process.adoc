= Release process

The release process is currently especially supported by local linting, testing and additional pipeline magic. And it's done out of the `main` branch, as we're not using something like gitflow or similar and a `dev` branch at the moment.

== Preparations
* Doing a link:adr/visual_regression_testing-backstopjs.html[visual regression testing] via `npm run test:visual-regression:test` that ensures no unexpected glitches due to the new release.
* All git commits get linted via link:adr/linting-git.html[commitlint], so we could easily collect all previous commit messages.
* Updating link:../CHANGELOG.md[/CHANGELOG.md] out of those commit messages accordingly.
** In case of any breaking changes we have to update the link:migrationGuide.html[/docs/migrationGuide.adoc] as well.
* Modifying the release version in the several different occurences within the system as well (mainly used for badges, changelog and link to package):
** link:../README.md[/README.md]
** link:getStarted.html[/docs/getStarted.adoc]
** link:../source/_patterns/04-pages/intro.hbs[/source/_patterns/04-pages/intro.hbs]
** link:../source/_patterns/04-pages/intro.json[/source/_patterns/04-pages/intro.json]
** Notice: Please pay attention not to change the value within link:../package.json[/package.json] manually, as we're doing this via a npm script.
* We've abstracted the final step of creating and publishing a new version (using link:https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version[`npm version`] and the necessary git tagging, commiting and pushing) with the `npm run release:minor` and `npm run release:patch` scripts.
