## Files and folder structure

patternlab system structure files and folders are formatted in italic. Most common aspects like `package.json` are being left out.

* `docs`: including relevant documentation as well as ADRs
* `_helpers_`: storing handlebars helper scripts
* `_public_`: for the _patternlab_ system exports
* `scripts`: internally used scripts for maintenance tasks

** `__meta_`: beginning and end (head and foot) code of the pattern files
** `__patterns_`: contains all of our pattern related files (HTML/hbs, CSS/SCSS, minimal JavaScript). The concept behind the structure is to have all of those technologies stored next to each other in an intuitive folder structure.
