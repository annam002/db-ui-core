In general we'd like to provide a robust, simple, mostly accessible and consumable Frontend framework, following web standards for future compatibility best usage within upcoming innovations.

That for we'd like to follow these principles:
* Divide markup (HTML) from styling (CSS) from functionality (JavaScript)
** Prevent to integrate framework specific markup & CSS annotations
** Setting up the layout via link:https://maintainablecss.com/chapters/semantics/[(semanticly) declarative and non-descriptive selectors)] instead of "visual helper" classes
** LEAN code in all of those technologies leads to less complexity, enables maintainability and performance aspects as well
* Provide the least JavaScript we're capable of in this software layer
** The JavaScript provided in the "popular" frameworks is often both much too simple as well as highly opinionated, with little possibility for extensions or customizations
** Doesn't necessarily work nicely with the frameworks we're using
** So we'd like to provide components as Web Components in the near future

On how design systems are build up in other organisations, there has been a survey lately which includes some very interesting findings that we could use for our work, strategy and processes: https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2019/
