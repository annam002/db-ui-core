There's clearly no good reason to use spaces over tabs within your code - but a lot that link:http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/[speaks against] it, as link:https://github.com/xojs/xo#space[pointed out by the XO authors] as well, but involves topics link:https://alexandersandberg.com/tabs-for-accessibility/[like accessibility] as well.
